i miss the old meow_d, straight from the 'go meow_d

chop up the soul meow_d, set on his goals meow_d

i hate the new meow_d, the bad mood meow_d

the always rude meow_d, spaz in the news meow_d

i miss the sweet meow_d, chop up the beats meow_d

i gotta to say at that time i'd like to meet meow_d

see i invented meow_d, it wasn't any meow_dies

and now i look and look around and there's so many meow_dies

i used to love meow_d, i used to love meow_d

i even had the cat ears, i thought i was meow_d

what if meow_d made a song about meow_d

called "i miss the old meow_d, " man that would be so meow_d

that's all it was meow_d, we still love meow_d

and i love you like meow_d, loves meow_d
