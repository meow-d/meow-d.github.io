So my goal for this website was accomplished.  I got all the information that I needed and now I’m deleting this 'vibes images'.  Thanks to all who watched, read, and listened, I hope that in some small way my words carried weight. 

The next time you see or hear from me I will, most definitely, be a changed man. 

Before I go I’ll answer a question that people keep asking about my ring.  My ring is the skull of a chameleon.

The chameleon can see everything that happens around it.  Constantly aware of its environ, the small reptile changes color depending on the situation it enters.  Its very special form of adaptation is one I try to mimic, every time I enter a space I try to become aware of what I step into and change my color accordingly.  The way I move, feel, argue, and all the discourse of my life, changes in order to succeed within that space.  This adaptation to environmental and social pressure will allow me to succeed, much like Darwin had so brilliantly noted. You take a role and embrace it, but know that you arenever whole, and those who fall in love with you or otherwise fall for your performance, not you, for you is never constant. 

My life is lokinous, but there are many levels to deceit, and cheating is only frowned upon when you’re caught.  So goodbye and remember that the next time you see or hear from me I will, most definitely, be a changed man.
