    <h2>Collection of websites i think are cool</h2>
    <p>
        I don't know most of these people, these are not endorsements of their views, i just think their site is cool,
        i don't agree on them on everything, saying this just in case they say something stupid.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <h3>Designs i like</h3>

            <a href="https://pixelde.su/">Pixel</a> - dissapointed to learn that
            Poly is a girl tho.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://split.pet/">Split</a> - ok we're technically mutuals but not like close enough to put in
            the mutuals section. but even if we're not mutuals i'd still put it here.

        <li>
            <a href="https://redlib.lesbnyan.top/">someone's Redlib instance dedicated to yuri</a> - i have no idea
            who owns this, but i don't need to know. all i know is that there's yuri.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://guzey.com/">Alexey Guzey</a> - i don't like lesswrong "rationalists", but i like how their
            blogs have a quality that makes you feel like you're getting a glimpse into their entire life. almost
            inspiring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://girl.surgery/website_vibes/">vibes screenshots by... urm... Sophia..?</a> - wait what am i
            supposed
            to call her...? actually, what even is she? this is a brand new flavour of transfem to me and i'm scared.
            but i digress. i might steal this vibe screenshots idea someday.
