    <h2>Websites i think are cool but I don't know these people</h2>
    <p>
        these are not endorsements of their views, i just think their site is cool, i don't agree on them on everything,
        saying this just in case they say something stupid.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://guzey.com/">Alexey Guzey</a> - i don't like lesswrong "rationalists", but i like how their
            blogs have a quality that makes you feel like you're getting a glimpse into their entire life. almost
            inspiring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://pixelde.su/">Pixel</a> - the design is INSANE i love it so much. dissapointed to learn that Poly is a girl tho.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://split.pet/">Split</a> - ok we're technically mutuals but not like close enough to put in
            the mutuals section. but even if we're not mutuals i'd still put it here.
        </li>
