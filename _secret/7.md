title: the dream girl.

i met a girl named _____. i forgot what she looked like - sometimes she's a cool tomboy with cute small breasts, sometimes a messy girlfailure insisting she's not pretty without her makeup, sometimes she's a loli. all i know, she's the prettiest person i've ever seen. really, i don't think i'll ever see anyone prettier than her ever ever. she's good at everything too - better than anyone at everything, absolutely confidence that crushes all. she never understood what it's like to work hard for something, a blessing or a curse depending on who you ask. she's just that awesome, you know. i think she's... perfect.

then i woke up, and now i have to bear her name.
