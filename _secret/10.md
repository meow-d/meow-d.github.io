oh, this?

sorry, we've been meaning to tell you, but we never had a chance.

when you were 3, they discovered something about your genes, we signed up for a little something.

they were watching you the entire time.

a sample like this couldn't survive, not without special care.

it's a rare defect. you weren't supposed to exist. it's natural selection.

they wanted to see what happens if you live. fooled by empathy, we wanted to see it live too.

so, candle princess, in a greenhouse. we were told this is the only way you'd survive.

we're sorry, that we could only find learning materials for humans.

vibrant. beautiful. we live for as long as colors exist. every life is worth living.

fooled by our empathy, we thought you could be human too. see, humans cannot comprehend something that don't deserve to live.

now you seek humanity. now you seek our joy. now you seek our pain.

we should never have taught you how to smile.

sometimes we hope, maybe you'd die before we have to tell you. but here we are.

it's not your fault. aren't you glad? you were simply never meant to be. incapable of trying in the first place.

we're proud of how far you've come, we were so happy when you made your first friend.

we'll always love you, cause no one else would.

we'll see if the subject makes it past 20.
