title: some porter robinson lyrics
---

i found a letter,

"dear future me,

i promise to take care of the person we'll both be eventually

i'll pick up painting,

oh, oh, and i'll join the gym

i can't shake the feeling that i'll be happy by the time i'm him"

it would be so much easier to love you

if you could only see

yourself

like

me
