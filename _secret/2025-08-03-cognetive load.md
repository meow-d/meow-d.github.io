title: Managing cognetive load
---

I am currently not diagnosed with anything, but anyone can tell I'm not exactly neurotypical. I genuinely don't know if I have autism or ADHD or anything, but I know my problems.

I'm not sure if my brain is different, but i get tired extremely easily. and when i do, my brain gets too slow to think in real-time, working memory gets significantly nerfed (as in, RAM, not hard disk). I start going on autopilot and follows my instincts without thinking, causing me to overexert myself and making me even more tired.

I'm like a computer swapping important stuff just to run a video game and freezing the DE, so that you can't even close your apps. When I'm tired, I skip things like showering and journaling to prioritize the task in front of me. It's like a carrot dangling in front of head it's just hours of shortsightedness thinking the problem will go away if I just try for 5 more minutes. In the worst-case scenario, I get to a point where I keep forgetting what I'm currently doing and start moving on to different tasks.

i think seeing the problem in the lens of cognitive load theory makes sense. it's literally an indispensable part of ui/ux - non-tech-literate people tend to be inefficient with computers due to a combination of unoptimized workflows and unfamiliarity. the version of me in extreme tiredness resembles these people with how messy my technology usage is.

luckily i _am_ tech literate, i can always try making my workflows more optimized to manage my cognitive load. to varying degrees of success.
