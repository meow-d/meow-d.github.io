title: no, you don't hate politics in video games.

no, you don't hate politics in video games. you hate politics that make you uncomfortable. it's your empathy. you want to live in a world where bigotry doesn't exist. humans instinctively run away and believe something just because it's better that way. perhaps you wish you weren't complicit in ignorance, surrounded with privilege. perhaps you grew up miserable, you hate watching weaker people getting sympathy when you're here alone - "in what way did the supposed privilege helped me?" perhaps you grew up as man who never learned how to grief and heal together, instinctively shouting at someone after accidentally hurting them. perhaps you hate people who act smug about being better people, your pride getting in your way.

it would be hypocritical for me to criticize you when i'm asking you to empathize with someone else. instead, i wish to extend my empathy to you, hoping you will return the favour to someone else. i know you suffered to get here, but you're not alone. it wouldn't do anyone any good if you keep denying reality. just because your suffering is ignored doesn't mean you have to ignore other's.

equality cannot be completed without freeing the other side. i am you. we don't know how to grief, that's why we express it in anger, still playing into this stupid game that no one likes. let's just end this already.
