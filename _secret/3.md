i know what you're addicted to. watching you destory yourself and everything around you. you're not helpless. you just happened to do nothing. your hand is bleeding, which you think it's so sad and cool, but it's not. stop scaring them. you've cried wolf too many times, they can't feel sorry towards you anymore, even if they tried.
