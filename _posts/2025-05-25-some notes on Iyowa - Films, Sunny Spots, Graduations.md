title: Some notes on Iyowa - Films, Sunny Spots, Graduations
---

in the meow_d internal rating system, iyowa has a few "legendary" songs under his belt - namely kyu kurarin, heat abnormal, and the peachy key. 3 songs of that level is more than enough to earn my respect. the least i can do is try to get into his music.

unfortuantely i didn't enjoy _Films, Sunny Spots, Graduations_ much. i find the songs too similar-sounding, the fact that it's a super lengthly double album doens't help. you can say that they're weak individually, as in, they don't make much of an impact on me. i feel like i needed to clarify that because the production work and songwriting is anything but weak. if anything, that only made me feel worse about the fact that i didn't enjoy the album.

there's also the fact that i can't understand japanese.. i know i wouldn't have loved artists like porter robinson and jamie paige if not for their extremely strong lyrics, it makes me sad that non-english speaking fans are probably missing out on a lot. so now it's their turn to feel bad for me for missing out on the iyowa writing and the iyowa girls and the iyowa girls lore and the iyowa girls love if that's a thing.

funnily enough, the song that made the biggest impact on me is the last song, graduation ceremony / 卒業式. no vocals or anything, just piano and clapping.wav,  a simple combination enough to drive me to tears. it makes me laugh at my own simple feeble mind.
