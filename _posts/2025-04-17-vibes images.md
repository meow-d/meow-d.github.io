title: You should have a vibes images page
---

if you're here, you probably knew about my vibes images page / gallery dump. it's a reference to [sophia_cisgirl's vibes images page](https://girl.surgery/website_vibes/).

there are several pretty big differences though, mainly the fact that mine isn't randomized (because im lazy), and it's laid out nicely in a grid instead of being scattered around. well it's not really _that nice_, there are those awkward gaps because [masonry](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#masonry-layout) isn't really a thing in css yet. i never bothered to figure out any workarounds.

i think it's obvious from the content that im from a very different background from sophia. in contrast to her text-heavy screenshots, the vast majority of my images are taken up by anime art i saved to my gallery, a lot of them nsfw. i don't think sophia's version is particularly safe-for-work either, but it's all diluted by the sheer amount of screenshots. so unfortunately now i have friends calling it my "gooner page", and i had to add a nsfw warning because i didn't know there are minors clicking on the site. oh well.

in a way, it's a hybrid of the original vibes images and something like [julie's yuri page](https://zoey-on-github.github.io/yuri.html), which is why i cited that as an inspiration too. julie is what i like to call the "scientology of orbiters" - interact with her once and she'll stick around you forever. her personality also happens to feel like it's engineered in a lab to be as annoying as possible. this is not relevant to the conversation i just felt like being mean to someone. i digress.

i thought i was weird for thinking that studying a person from the little glimpses of their life is cool, so i was just putting myself out there hoping for something. so i was really surprised that people i know actually loved the site and the idea, with some even getting inspired and wanting to make their own..... though i am also very disappointed that no one actually did.

anyways, if you wanna make your own, check out [sophia's gist here](https://gist.github.com/sophiawisdom/c1b16fcaca017d1aec2358c6fb619697) for the authentic experience... or just cobble something together yourself, especially if you're a javascriptphobe. for the images, just go through your pictures folder and copy stuff you want into a folder; you should also add a new album in your gallery app and add stuff there too.

and some common sense: please don't just dump your entire gallery. make sure whatever's in there can't be used to doxx you - though it's up to you how strict you want to define doxxing (i have a rule where i don't have images taken anywhere near i live). and strip all the exif data. if you want you also can give them all random file names since they do contain dates and stuff.

vibes images pages are terrible from an opsec perspective, aren't they? so much juicy information. it's partially why i removed mine - like, it was cool, i trust everyone who had seen it so far, but i fear it's gonna come back and bite me at some point.

## list of vibes images i know
- [sophia's original vibes images](https://girl.surgery/website_vibes/)
- [Alexey Guzey's](https://guzey.com/vibes/)
- [Xavi's](https://xavicf.com/vibes.html)
- mine [(now ](/website_vibes)[removed)](https://www.tumblr.com/coletureconceptarchive/35941277163/so-my-goal-for-this-website-was-accomplished-i)
- edit: [aria's](https://aria.coffee/gallery/aria-board/) - inspired by this very post i suppose. definitely much closer to mine than anything, both in terms of style and content, due to similar demographic i guess

### not really vibes images
- [angel's](https://anx.vg/vibes) - i lied. there's one inspired by mine. problem is 1) it's not _really_ a vibes images page, it's been ship of theseus'd into a page where she puts whatever she thinks is cool. which is vaguely in the spirit of the original i guess...? 2) the site is very very WIP... sharing someone's WIP site is kind of an asshole move, isn't it?
