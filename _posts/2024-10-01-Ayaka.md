please watch Ayaka: A Story of Bonds and Wounds. I promise it's not worth it. I promise you'll come out thinking it's mid. because it's mid.

you'll start seeing art differently. you'll see the passion the artists put into their art in any medium, and you'll think of Ayaka, trying to remember any semblance of artistic vision. you'll think, thank god this isn't like Ayaka.

it takes a true mid anime to appreciate 6/10 anime.
