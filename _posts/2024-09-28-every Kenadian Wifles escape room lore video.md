---

"what kind of loser actually cares about Kenadian lore?" i do. i'm the loser. sorry for being cringe.

and sorry if i miss anything, i'm not a hardcore Kenidian fan.

## videos
### main story
- [Kenadian - The Wifies Debunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnArLTmJa6w)
  - Kenadian's POV
  - cuts off before the ending to direct you to Wifies's video

- [Wifies - Can I Beat My Own Escape Room?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xORJ6sQsMbE)
  - Wifies' POV

### epilogue?
- [Wato1876 - How To Make the Best Escape Room in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAoEMV75H7c)
  - normal video uploaded 2 months before the main video, with snippets of lore
  - not sure if the snippets take place before or after the main story

- [Wato1876 - The True Creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOPbQHuiJ0)
  - connects everything to Kenadian's existing lore with the Omz mask, which i am not familiar with

- [Kenadian - but there was more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BFXFjUG4q4)

### split second easter eggs (may or may not have lore implications)
- [Wato1876 - Debunking The Largest Escape Room in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFUQDTLnW0g)
  - a normal video, but there's a split second easter egg of the escape room near the beginning

- [Wato1876 - When you okay on bedrock edition and phase through the ground](https://youtube.com/shorts/_cZC9DsKeRI)
  - shorts
  - you can see the omz mask for a split second

### bonus (not part of lore... as far as I can tell)
