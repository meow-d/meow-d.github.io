pros:
- the characters are hot

cons:
- the pacing is slow. 26 chapters but we're still at the beginning. not a bad thing necessarily, but it's not gonna get to the good part until 2027.
- it's really... cliche...

### side note (re: [this tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nejirehadofangirl/video/7490650080861539626))

i can't imagine a gokurakugai anime adaptation going well, for a story that's this carried by the art, AND especially for a story with such a slow start and cliche plot.

to be fair, if there's anything that solo leveling and mashle taught us, it's that you don't need to surpass a source material's art, you just need to be good enough. however. if there's anything sakamoto days taught us, if you fall short of that, you're cooked. by "that" i mean you need to be A-1 Pictures level.

i pray that some god level character designer like kappe would work on it.
