![a manga page. i have no idea how to alt text this](/assets/images/post-images/There's Weird Voices Coming from the Room Next Door! - Vol.1 Ch.3 - 5.png)

I'm usually super disconnected with most romance manga. I can't relate to having a social life, being in high school, being a girl, living in a yuri utopia where everyone is gay and homophobia doesn't exist. given my love for yuri, it's ironic that I actually connect more with heterosexual romance manga - both the male and female protag, mostly the latter.

`There's Weird Voices Coming from the Room Next Door!` is different? i think? It's not realistic by any means - it's a pure lesbian fantasy that will never happen in real life. but it never crosses the line of feeling "fake", like 90% of other manga.

i haven't seen people talking about it at all, and it's not really special on paper. so my theory is that this manga is just... made for me. and most other people will never feel my connected to the protagonist, Nakano. she's an 18-year-old uni student who has to learn to live alone. she's not particularly messy or anything, but she definitely does not has her life figured out. she just like me fr fr.
