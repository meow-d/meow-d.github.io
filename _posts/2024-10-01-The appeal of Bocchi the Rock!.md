title: The appeal of Bocchi the Rock! is the oddly specific details
---

Bocchi has quite a lot of _oddly specific details_ that you will only understand if you've been through it. and i mean **a lot**. i've seen people mention a lot of things that i cannot relate to. because everyone has had _some_ social anxiety at some point, even "extroverts" can pick up a thing or two. sometimes, there will be something that hits too close to home. when added up, it can feel like bocchi is staring into your soul.

one of those _oddly specific details_ is bocchi's wildness. whenever someone mentions me they'll always go "i don't know anything about _him_ cause _he_'s always quietly sitting in the corner", when i'm in fact a pretty loud person in my own world. i know a lot of introverts are like that too: wild and loud on the inside, but quiet on the outside. bocchi's wild imagination is a pretty relatable thing. i do admit that the parts where bocchi actually goes wild is less relatable, but i guess introverts love seeing bocchi act like the crazy girl that she is, because we rarely get to do that. to me, this is the biggest reason i don't relate to Komi (from Komi can't Communicate, duh). she comes off as a quiet, elegant princess who doesn't like to talk, but she's actually a quiet, elegant princess with communication disorder.

personally, the one that hit hardest is the youth complex thing. you see young people (in media or irl) enjoying youth, falling in love, make friends, etc, then you start wondering what went wrong in your life to end up like this.

Bocchi the rock is walking a thin line between maintianing the fantasy by being loser enough to be relatable, while not being too unrelistic to avoid invoking jelousy from viewers. It's really good at it, but I can see that fail for some people.
