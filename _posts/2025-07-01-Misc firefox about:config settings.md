* `browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent` / `browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrentExceptPinned`
  * a personal preference

* `toolkit.tabbox.switchByScrolling`
  * for some reason, this functionality is enabled by default on chrome linux specifically. i don't think it's even enabled on chrome windows, or firefox anywhere. when i was first using linux AND still used chrome AND my scroll wheel wasn't broken, it was my main way of navigating between tabs.

* `network.predictor.enable-hover-on-ssl`
  + prefetching is enabled by default but this isn't
  + ublock origin disables prefetching entirely for privacy reasons, so you'd have to disable that option in `settings > privacy > uncheck "disable pre-fetching"`
