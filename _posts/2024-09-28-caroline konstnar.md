title: on Caroline Konstnar

(i'm not qualified to speak on the topic (and neither is she))

look, i'll try to be fair to her:
- she has _things_ to say about being a youtuber and parasocial relationships
- she understands people are pissed for good reason
- a lot of things said about the situation is wrong, due to how the internet sensationalized the drama. for example, she's not doing it to promote her patreon, nor is it intended to be a "social experiment"
- great choice to put the response on patreon, since the internet will make it even worse

that's it. now for a list of things that went wrong.

## a list of things that went wrong
### the pregnancy announcement video
- not making it clear that it's a joke, while only the most dedicated fans figured out it's a joke
- picking a sensitive topic for the joke
- portrays herself in a difficult situation, causing people to sympathize. a lot of commentors have relatives who have been through the same thing, or went through it themselves.

### the second video
- adds a new sensitive topic (miscarriage). the thumbnail is just....
- "the joke is that you believed it" will 100% piss the believers off
- talks about parasocial relationship, yet rewards the most dedicated fans
- plugging patreon in the end, making it easier to make fun of you
- NOT apologizing
- >[fans who werenâ€™t parasocial to begin with feel slighted, presumably leave. now your audience is full of a bunch of weirdos](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1ci1xdo/comment/l280m4r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

strangely, this video was taken down, but not the first one.

### Patreon response video

- still NOT apologizing
- trying to be deep at all. she's barely older than me.
- goes on a tangent about.... cancel culture? comments on the internet when you're the one needing it?
- using phrases that people can easily use against her
  - i don't care
  - i am not ashamed of what i did
  - just get over it
  - cancel culture
  - triggered
  - anti-fragility

thank god she did not make this video public.

## my take
my take is that she genuinely thought it was funny, then realise she fucked up. in the Patreon response video, you can see her trying to cope with it. she may or may not have come up with the parasocial relationship commentary beforehand, but it's greatly helping her cope.

if there are any updates i missed feel free to comment. cause i'm not researching this ever again.
