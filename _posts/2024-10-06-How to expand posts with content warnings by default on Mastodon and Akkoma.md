title: How to expand posts with content warnings by default on Mastodon and Akkoma
---

## how
- Akkoma
  - Settings > General > Posts Look & Feel > untick Collapse posts with content warnings
- Mastodon
  - Preferences > Appearance> Sensitive content > tick Always expand posts marked with content warnings

### alternative frontends
- Moshidon
  - Settings > Display > enable Always reveal content warnings
  - probably also applies to the official app and Megalodon, idk

## why
I was a Cohost user. apparnetly the Cohost staff and most of the big users have a secret dark past: they were the people who created Mastodon's CW system and culture. [they are extemely critical of it today](https://shelraphen.com/on-content-warnings/), maybe because they felt guilty of what they have created.

changing Mastodon's CW system would obviously require a lot of work, _if_ people are willing to change in the first place.

i think the simplest possible "solution" is to just expand CWs by default, with sensitive images still hidden under a click, then use filters for anything you're sensitive to. essentially sacrificing the standard CWs and make everything opt in.

obviously, it's not a real solution, it's not for everyone, doing that to all existing Mastodon users is a bad idea. but still, you can solve the whole CW discourse only for yourself with just a single click.
