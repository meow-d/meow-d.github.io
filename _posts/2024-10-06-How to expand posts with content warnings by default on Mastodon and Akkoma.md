title: How to expand posts with content warnings by default on Mastodon and Akkoma
---

## how
- Akkoma
  - Settings > General > Posts Look & Feel > untick Collapse posts with content warnings
- Mastodon
  - Preferences > Appearance> Sensitive content > tick Always expand posts marked with content warnings

### alternative frontends
- Moshidon
  - Settings > Display > enable Always reveal content warnings
  - probably also applies to the official app and Megalodon, idk

## why
I was a Cohost user. apparnetly the Cohost staff and most of the big users have a secret dark past: they were the people who created Mastodon's CW system and culture. [they are extemely critical of it today](https://shelraphen.com/on-content-warnings/), maybe because they felt guilty of what they have created.

changing Mastodon's CW system would obviously require a lot of work, _if_ they're even willing to change.

i think the simplest possible solution is to just expand CWs by default, with sensitive images still hidden under a click. most of the criticisms is just the lack of CWs that don't hide your post by default - this is just sacrificing the standard CWs for optional CWs. if you're sensitive to a certain topic, you should already have those filtered anyways. i guess the other catch is that it's impossible to recreate Cohost's tag muffling with this.

obviously, doing that to all existing Mastodon users is a bad idea, but still, you can solve the whole CW discourse (albeit just for for yourself) with just a single click.
