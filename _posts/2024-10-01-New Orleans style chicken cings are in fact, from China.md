**新奥尔良烤翅**, or **New Orleans style chicken wings**, described [by WSJ](https://archive.is/ZltjF) as "mildly sweet and savory marinated meat", are exteremely popular in China due to its unique flavour. in fact, that New-Orleans-style-Wings flavor has been put into every food imaginable.

the catch is that it has nothing to do with New Orleans. it's 100% from China. some people on the internet say it's invented in KFC in the 90s.

New Orleans feels like a weird choice. i know nothing about that place and i assume the same goes with most people outside of the US. if i was in charge of picking a random place i'll go with "Las Vegas Chicken Wings" or something. but KFC China definitely knew what they were doing.
