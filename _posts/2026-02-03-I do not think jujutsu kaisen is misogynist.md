how did jujutsu kaisen get that reputation in the first place? well, it had a reputation for having good female representation in shonen, with a few major female characters. a couple of character deaths later, the ratio is pushed to a point where there's barely any major female characters [^1].

the main disagreement is our definition of misogyny is in media. people talk as if stories have an obligation of represent minorities, but i find the "silence is violence" ethos counterproductive to being progressive. i think of misogyny as an active problem, where the author goes out of their way to devalue women, whether they realize it or not. it reflects how the author thinks of people in real life and teaches that mindset to the audience. this is also why i'm so disturbed by stories like zom 100 despite not being explictly "problematic".

jujutsu kaisen isn't really misogynist in that sense. female characters were never really written differently in the first place. if anything, the deaths are just regular jjk fumbles, where the audience feels like they were promised more screen time for their favourite character, and feels too cheated to even care about what the author was truly going for. it's a shame because in hindsight, these were really poetic deaths.

[^1]: frankly, infamous character deaths are where nearly all perception of jjk's bad writing came from. if all of your favs survived we would all be glazing jjk.
