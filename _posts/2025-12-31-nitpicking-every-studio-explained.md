title: Nitpicking "Every Anime Studio Explained in 17+23 Minutes"
---

i'm not a sakuga nerd. he probably watches more anime than me, i'm just "more informed". no seriously i really expected the video to be normie slop but this guy seems to have put actual effort into research?

if you wanna be fair, this is a topic that infamously lacks public information. and it's a format where you have to research an insanely large range, and you only have like 5 minutes to explain each.

## nitpicking
### general working conditions rant
while it's true that the anime industry have terrible conditions, there is a lot of nuance impossible to tell as outsiders like us, even to sakuga nerds. it's never clear cut who to blame, you can't see the full picture unless you're literally there to watch it happen.

the worst thing fans can do is to pretend the problem doesn't exist, the second worst thing is a widespread shallow understanding of what's going on - e.g. mappa torture dungeon jokes. what comment sections love to do.

it's bad for the animator because those jokes desensitizes the problem and enforces the narrative that it's necessary to be this way for the quality. it's bad for the studio because it proves that the average person doesn't actually care enough to start real backlash, or care about improvements. we're seeing mappa genuinely trying to improve, yet the comments in the new jjk trailer are still that one joke.

lastly, i'm not sure highlighting specific incidences. i think it's needed, but it suffers from the same shallow understanding problem if presented without the surrounding context. and i don't know if the animators would want tweets on their *personal* account to be blasted to millions of ignorant fans.

### toei
looking at the staff list *always* gives a better picture than the studio.

### madhouse
i'm not into madhouse history but the "rebuilt" narrative sounds sus, their signature production line hasn't stopped producing bangers

### ghibli
i know he's referring to the older films being traditional, but no studio does it traditionally nowadays. from what i know, it's literally no longer possible to get the same materials. and also ghibli literally is the reason why opentoonz exist, so i'd say they contributed a lot to digital animation as well.

### sunrise
i think every studio on the list has at least multiple teams.

### trigger
describing gainax and trigger without the word "kanada" 💔

### mappa
bro thinks he on the team. (the shitty fraud leaker who's somehow lumped with industry legends and veterans in the screenshots)

same criticism about lack of surrounding context and showing personal vents, especially the rightmost screenshot.

(unconfirmed rumour incoming) the NDA thing might have been intended to combat leaks, since someone leaked an entire episode a while back (because people are too excited about the goat keiichiro watanabe), but it's extremely poorly implemented with the worst timing imaginable. i want to make a joke about how the leaker has no right to complain, but then again the "leaker" in question is a fake anyway, they never had any exclusive information.

### kyoani
lack of mention of the arson but i think everyone already knew.

mentioning mappa as an example without mentioning chainsaw man being 100% self funded?

### a1
use of the word "budget", 70 aura points deducted. i love nitpicking.

random jab on anime you personally don't like? 200 aura points deducted.

### science saru
>they don't care about nationality of their employees

well neither do other studios nowadays, but for the worst reasons.

### davidpro
when he said "co-director" i went to check, and it turned out to be those "chief director + director" things, where he's the director. i have no idea how does that work, i genuinely want to know lol.

unrelated personal note: undead unluck is unfortunate because the first episode looked so good but the rest is struggling so much. especially the compositing. it's probably a sin to watch an anime while bumping up the contrast and stuff, but in this case i can't really blame anyone.

### studio deen
good for him to explain it's not necessarily the studio's fault for disasters, though the konosuba comparison should have been used as an example - of how little the studio matters when it comes to quality, compared to the staff and schedule.

way of the househusband is a stylistic choice apparently. or so i've heard. i genuinely haven't researched this, third-hand info from reddit is not reliable, i could be dead wrong.

### dogakobo
mentioning kappe without mentioning rent a girlfriend is funny lol. i would argue her character designs are one of the most important componenets behind the franchise's success.

yay jellyfish mention.

### bind
yay q kawa mention.

### pinned comment
nice canipa effect shoutout.
