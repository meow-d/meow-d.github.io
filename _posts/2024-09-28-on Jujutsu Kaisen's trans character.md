title: on Jujutsu Kaisen's trans character
---

JJK dealt with its transgender character by doing literally nothing. She's just there and no character ever talks about it. Words like "crossdressinng" and "transgender" aren't even in the manga. The wiki still says she's male because that's the only thing we know about her.

I can see some people prefer it to be more explicit, but I'm satisfied with what we got. The representation is ultimately positive - she's a small side character with a cool design, everyone treats her normally.

I always hear people complain about queer characters having no personality other than being queer, or representation for the sake of representation. I think these people would be very happy with Kirara.

Also, something I don't see people discuss much: Kirara likely has some friction with Jujutsu High due to transphobia. I mean, she already hates them. Hakari beating up a conservative higher up could have something to do with that.
