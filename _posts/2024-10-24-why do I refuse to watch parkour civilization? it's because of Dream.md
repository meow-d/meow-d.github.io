title: Why do I refuse to watch parkour civilization? it's because of Dream.
---

you know why I was a Dream stan? because he was cringe and free. that guy just uploads cringy 40-minute long videos of him and his friends having fun, no one hated him for being cringe. everyone roots for that guy everytime he's mentioned.

and we all know what happened. sure, he was a genuine asshole, it was a pretty big controversy, but all it takes is one controversy and cringe culture took over with no chance of recovery. it's hard to hate on people for being cringe without looking like the asshole that you are. that's why people hide behind legitmate reasons. once it's cool to hate him, it's a free for all, you can just make shit up now.

parkour civilization is a ticking time bomb. maybe there will be some controversy, maybe not. eventually, people will start viewing it as the worst thing ever. I have no faith in the internet to be kind, to let people be themsleves. give them one spark and everything will be burned into the ground.

for the record, i never fully believed the groomer thing in the first place, i was just cautious and waiting for evidence. now that [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18jB0zQysgg) is up, the consensus is that he really didn't do anything.
