i'm impressed by how viable OpenUtau is for an open source audio production software. i mean, practically no one uses open source software in the music production world, unless you're a specifically a foss nerd. look, i love foss, but let's be real: but no one knows what Ardour is unless you're in a foss subreddit. no one cares about that song you made with 100% foss plugins. the old ZynAddSubFX UI could kill the average ableton user. the closest thing we have is Vital, which only open sourced an old version.

OpenUtau, on the other hand, is not used because it's open source - no vocal synth producer cares about foss. it's not mainstream by any means, but people do consider it _an option_.

and it has ✨AI✨! Two different AI-based renderers, in fact! idk why i expected the latest technologies to be gatekept by proprietary software. i haven't tried NNSVS/ENUNU yet cause the setup seems like a pain, but DiffSinger is built-in, with minimal setup (just drag and drop the vocoder thingy).

it _is_ super buggy, it _is_ unpopular, but it exceed my expectations, cause i have very low expectations when i hear "open source" and "music production" together.

correction: there are 3 AI options, since OpenUtau supports Voicecox voicebanks. Thought you need your own installation of Voicevox running in the background for now.

and I was not aware that Voicevox itself is also open source.

_so urm, year of the open source music production when???_
