title: Uncontroversial thoughts on Bryan Johnson

in a vacuum, i think it's cool[^1] that someone is doing that kind of self experimentation, like "what if someone just healthmaxxed"[^2]. in reality, bryan johnson has smelly venture capitalist vibes. it's a demographic that believe they can change the world alone without ever looking at the shoulders they're standing on, and the same mindset is now being used on science. ageing is a problem as old as time, as complex as the universe. for a rich outsider to come in and claim they've solved it is disrespectful.

bryan johnson's blueprint protocol isn't "scientific", obviously. you just can't create create the ultimate paper by combining every possible paper, that's just a literature review. it doesn't say anything about how each change will interact, much less all of them at once. it's about as proven as nothing, and that's the definition of alternative medicine.

i have no problem with alternative medicine as long as they're transparent about the efficacy. hopefully, people would seek normal proven medicine when it's life threatening. i wish he is honest about how he's just doing some crazy bullshit. it sounds less grandiose but i love bullshit! does he _have_ to pretend it's scientific and create a business of it? are venture capitalists devoid of joy?

and, why is he getting so much media attention and invited to so many talks? i know the answer. real research is boring and we all want stories. what if - there's a very smart rich man, who founded a company that pieced together the perfect scientific protocol against ageing, and now he's changing the world by spreading the knowledge? what if - his perfected formula is available at the low price of $49.00 at h-t-t-p-s blue print dot bryan johnson dot com? wouldn't that be amazeballs?

[^1]: people are weirded out by the blood exchange thing he did with his son, but "my feelings say it's wrong" is not a good argument for why something is wrong. like that's the exact reason why you cannot convince your conservative relative homophobia is wrong. it's dumb _because_ they're taking risks for something that 100% doesn't work, and dragging his son into his self-experimentation.

[^2]: i do think that kind of hyper-optimized life is joyless. i think i'm just not the demographic for this, and frankly most people would be turned off by his lifestyle. i would rather choose a happier life than 200 years of joyless routine. i definitely don't envy his life enough to want to buy his health supplements.
