title: Bitcoin Satoshi Vision
---

You've heard of Bitcoin and it's legendary Satoshi Nakamoto. You might have heard of Bitcoin Cash, the hard fork that's actually usable as cash instead of just a store of value.

Enter Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, the one fork to end them all, free of the corruption of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, from the hands of Satoshi Nakamoto, the god himself, revealed to us in the form of an [unknown australian genius][1], as Wired called him. There are haters, of course, not everyone belives jesus was the messiah, so [please ignore that Binance delisted BSV and the CEO called Satoshi a fraud](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/15/binance-delists-bitcoin-sv-ceo-calls-craig-wright-a-fraud). Quote, "The real Satoshi can digitally sign any message to prove it. This is as simple as breathing for him/her. And we have the pub key.", end quote.

Guess what, hater? He actually [did it](https://archive.ph/20160502072026/http://www.drcraigwright.net/jean-paul-sartre-signing-significance/). Yeah you litte shi- oh wait nvm the signature is just from a random Satoshi transaction. The base64 at the top of the post? it's... just a message that says "Wright, it is not the same as if I sign Craig Wright, Satoshi.", not a signature or anything. Okay. Ah. HA HA funny tricks Satoshi. You' are so funny.

NOW letS's visit his webbed site.... [H T T P S colon slash slash craig wright dot net...](https://craigwright.net)

DR CRAIG STEVEN WRIGHT IS NOT SATOSHI NAKAMOTO
On 20 May 2024, Dr Craig Steven Wright was found by the High Court of England and Wales to have been dishonest in his claims to have been the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of Bitcoin).
The Court found that Dr Wright “lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly” in his evidence and that he attempted to create a false narrative by forging documents “on a grand scale” and presenting them in evidence. Overall, “all his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.” In advancing his false claim to be Satoshi through multiple legal actions, Dr Wright committed “a most serious abuse” of the process of the courts of the UK, Norway and the USA. The High Court formally declared as follows:
First, that Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.
Second, Dr Wright is not the owner of the copyright in the Bitcoin White Paper.
Third, Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period between 2008 and 2011.
Fourth, Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system.
Fifth, Dr Wright is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin Software.
The full judgment, and its appendix detailing various forged documents created by Dr Wright, is accessible at the following URL: https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/copa-v-wright/.
Dr Wright has been ordered not to commence any legal proceedings based on his false claims (by claim or counterclaim) or procure any other person to do so. He has also been ordered not to threaten any such proceedings (explicitly or implicitly) or procure any other person to do so.">

Ok, nevermind. if the court says so. I've been fooled. Why would Satoshi Nakamoto public reveal himself after years of being anonymous.

So clearly, Satoshi Nakamoto is Elon M-
