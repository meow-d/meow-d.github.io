when i was in primary school, we have those whiteboards where there's a screen in the middle when you slide it open. on rare occasions (substitute teacher, special celebrations, etc) the students would have free reign to show whatever they want with the computer.

so there's this guy named _____, who told everyone he's gonna play something interesting. and to my surprise, he played: "Marshmello - Alone (Official Music Video)".

obviously, your average Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Cina kids don't understand Marshmello. so they started making fun of him. "his only company is a hamster? what a loser." _____ stood there as he watched everyone demolish his favorite(?) artist. he stopped the music video quickly because it's really humiliating to him, so we never got to that part where Marshmello stops being a loser.

he, and i, never brought up Marshmello ever again.

my point is, _____ is just like Mahiru from Jellyfish Can't Swim In The Night; but instead of jellyfish, it's hit American electronic music producer and DJ Marshmello. and also kids are fucking ruthless and will tear apart everything if they arbitrarily decide it's not cool.
