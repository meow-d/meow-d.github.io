Do you know people call Lumine 爷 in the CN fandom? 爷 not as in grandpa, but as in 少爷 (young master).

Apparently it started out as people mispronouncing her name (荧), and then it caught on cause it fits her sassy attitude really well. i genuinely don't know how one would mispronounce 荧 as 爷 though.
