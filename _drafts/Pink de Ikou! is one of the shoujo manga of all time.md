![I took a photo of a panel where: the FMC was telling her crush "如、如果你對女生沒興趣，我可以從今天起再也不當女生！要是你對男生有興趣，我就開始當男生！" and the everyone watching is shocked 😦 ofc](/assets/images/post-images/pink-de-ikou.jpg)

the other day I was at a clinic and there's a bookshelf with a very interesting selection of books. sure, we have your typical self-help/management/finance books for the adults, some Doraemon in Chinese for the kids... but we also have unexpected stuff like "The Sexual Life of Catherine M", "The Program: How to Find a Husband After 30: a 15-step Action Plan Using what I Learned at Harvard Business School", and a ton of old school shoujo manga (in Chinese). so I just picked one shoujo manga at random.

there is nothing to talk about in this manga. this is the most shoujo a manga has ever shoujo'ed. everything here are all troupes you've seen before. fuck Demon Slayer, this is what true mediocre looks like: it's so average that you can't even talk about it.

I sound like I hate this manga but I really don't. it's right up my alley, it's exactly my thing, and I'm eating it up like it's Lay's®️. if someone doesn't like Lay's®️ it's fair because there is nothing deep about a bag of chips. but don't you dare try to take away my bag of chips.

and my bag of chips was taken away from me. I ended up only reading 2/3 of it because I had to go. just like junk food, I have no desire to finish it after i stop, I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything.

though, in the end i did finish it, through scans on pirate sites, but only because i posted about this on Cohost and felt an obligation. surprisingly, there are even a couple chapters scanlated into English on Mangadex.
