title: Some notes on Mr Morale
---

Mr Morale is an anti-woke album where he misgenders a trans person and says homophobic slurs.

wow that sounds really really bad out of context. but i'm not wrong.

i like how Auntie Daries portrays a kid struggling to perceive someone's gender, with its inconsistent pronouns/misgendering. the song wouldn't have been half as effective without it. it sounds really bad if you treat it as a song about being an ally, cause it's not. it's about him learning how to be an ally, made for people who are struggling to accept queer people like he was.

the album is anti-woke, not as in "fuck the woke people i should be allowed to say slurs", but "I am not your saviour". i think it's very intentional that Auntie Diaries is right after Savior for two reasons: he's still talking about social issues, but he's not here to "save trans people", cause he is not your savior; in Savior he said "i find it just as hard to love thy neighbor", then showed how long it took him to fully accept trans people. and then in the end he used "love thy neighbor" to defend his relatives in church.
