title: What actually happened during Dream's 2021 Pride Month donation controversy?
---

_a bit of research on the situation i've done back in the day, not as complete as i've liked, but i'm not researching further cause i really don't like researching internet drama._

## the story
the narrative goes like this: Dream promised to donate all money he earned during his streams in pride month, but did not stream for the month. And then only streamed on the last day after being called out.

as usual, the source are all just random tweets. [this one tweet seems to have significance.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630171210/https://twitter.com/gunksnorter/status/1410250025746276353), but i'm probably missing a few tweets.

## timeline on what actually happened

- Here's the original promise made on his (now deleted) private account. most fans don't know about it, so all accusations of clout farming fall flat there. I actually had to do some digging for all of this, since the sources that most people have been using are all tweets by random people without any sources. Says a lot about society.
  - i would love to get an archived link, but it's probably impossible because private account.

- Throught June, he had already streamed multiple times before being 'called out'. [MyNameXavin (account now deleted) has done the research for this](https://web.archive.org/web/20211016071840/https://www.reddit.com/user/MyNameXavin/comments/p75g5i/dream_stream_discord_podcasts_in_june/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). I'm just gonna quote him here, though this does include the later streams he has done:

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Everything is in order</strong></p><p><em>Note: Dream’s Merch podcast “chat” is held in his Twitch Chat.

- the "callout tweets" blew up at some point

- He later streamed on the last day
  - For extra context, he very rarely streams.

- In the end, [$140K were donated to the Trevor Project](https://twitter.com/dreamwastaken/status/1410361954192039939), if you take his word for it.

## conclusion
the main takeaway is that people can just lie on the internet. and most people will just believe it. and we all have believed in a lot of lies. i guess the only thing you can feasibly do is never share something unless you're absolutely sure it's true?
