I ship Akito and Mizuki solely to piss off Ena. Not Ena fans (I love them) (I am one of them), but Ena herself.

I want to see her reaction to her brother dating her best friend. I want to see her flabbergasted.

I want her to realize she actually likes her brother's company. I want her to realize her annoying brother and best friend are both taken away from her at the same time.

Would nightcord fall apart? Would she try to win Mizuki's heart? Would Mizuki cheat on Akito? Would Ena date her brothe- wait. sorry. been reading too much oshi no ko recently
