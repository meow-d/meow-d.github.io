*I heard someone calling me from outside the car. so I opened the car door.*

*that guy told me something about congratulations you're lucky*

*I think he told me to talk through the car window instead, so I did that*

"young man, you're lucky, you're blessed with good luck, do you know why?"

"no"

"do you know astrology?" *pulls up his wallet with weird symbols*

"yes?"

"what's your name?"

"..."

"what's your name?"

"... sorry, not interested"

*pulls up photo of children in a shitty house* "do you want to donate to help the children?"

"no"

"do you want to save the children?"

"no"

"ok good luck" *reaches out his hand*

*I shook his hand in the most awkward way possible*

*he walks away*
