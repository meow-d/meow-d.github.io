the basic gameplay loop of Noita is explore, holy mountain, explore, holy mointain...
- **exploration**: survive, kill enemies, loot
- **holy mountain**: heal, refill water, shop for stuff, edit wands, select perks

## exploration
the loot here includes:
- **wands**
- **spells**
- **max health upgrades**
- **items**

one of the most important thing in the game is **water**. water neutralises toxic sludge, puts out fire, evaporates acid, etc. if you don't start with water, throw out the liquid inside and get water as soon as you can. note that swamp and brine acts the same as water.

treat Noita as a hardcore survival game, as healing is exteremely rare. try to take no damage. you will not suceed, but it'll train you to be as careful as possible.

here's a tip applicable to every roguelite: remember to utilize all the resources you have.
- test out spells that you think are trash, cause they might actually be good.
- use that bottle of invisiblum that's been sitting around in your inventory.
- use Ambrosia in difficult situations. it's good enough to completely counter Big Steve.
- etc...

## wands and spells
here are some common things your wands can do, classified by the community:
- main damage wand
- digging wand
- teleport wand
- healing wand
- the "exteremely high damage, can easily kill me, only reserved for bosses, DO NOT FIRE" wand

in god runs, people usually like to combine different types into their teleport. like teleport + digging + healing + damage.

### spells
**multicast** and **trigger** spells are essentials. there is a lot of variety, some are easier to use than others, but they're all functional.

over time, you'll develop a mental tier list on which spells are good. the only way to learn is to spend time in the community and read the wiki. that said, i'm going to list a few spells/combos that i consider to be S-tier:
- add mana
- reduce recharge time
- chainsaw + any multicast
- lumi drill + ping pong path
- freeze charge modifier
- homing + mist + damage field / damage plus
- homing + rock
- shield
- any healing

### wand stats
wand stats might seem overwhelming at first, but you usually only need to look for 2-3 stats, depeneding on which stage of the game you're at, and what you have. for example:
- in early game, look for wands with low cast delay and recharge time
- at some point, you'll have to start looking for decent no-shuffle wands
- if you're able to negate cast delay with the overpowered multicast + chainsaw combo, look for the low recharge time wands
- once you get spells that can speed up wands, mana recharge becomes the main bottleneck
- then, as you get into late game, capacity becomes more and more important.

## holy mountain
the loot here includes:
- **wands**
- **spells**
- **perks**

remember to refill your water

### perks
like spells, you'll develop a mental tier list of the good perks. here are some that i consider to be S-tier:
- edit wands everywhere
- projectile repelling field
- shield
- all the immunities (except for poison)
- concentrated spells [(if you know how to utilise it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxe3jCd2XjI)

maybe stop picking up glass cannon. or not.

### breaking the loop
not sure if this counts as a spoiler. probably mind-blowing for a beginner, but it's only a small taste of the sheer amount of freedom that Noita gives you.

you can enter/exit the holy mountain without collapsing, besically giving you a home to return to edit wands anytime.
- teleportanium
  - if you found unstable teleportatium, you can stablelize it with slime, which is easily found in the coal pits. just pour out a bit of liquid to make space, add some slime to your flask, and shake it around.
- teleport wand
  - there's a square hitbox that triggers the holy mountain collapse. by shooting a teleport bolt right through it, you can bypass it.
  - requries some skill. there is some risk of you accidentally missing.
  - unlike most other methods, this does not allow you to go back to previous biomes.
- polymorphine
  - if you go through the hitbox while polymorphed, it will not trigger
  - risky, as enemies can easily kill you while polymorphed.
  - it's also exteremely hard to get back into the holy mountain. one more reason to master tablet surfing, i guess.
- just dig out
  - brickwork is exteremely tough. ways of digging brickwork include:
    - lumi drill
    - plasma
    - tablet digging
  - you'll anger the gods and will have to deal with Steve

### dealing with Steve and Skoude
ways to counter **Steve**:
- statue
  - there's a reliable setup with the statue at the most left. but remember to check if it's stuck beforehand.
- tablet
  - my prefered method.
- freeze + kick
- plasma beam
- homing rock
- spray pheromones while invisible
- ambrosia (to negate damage)
- just run away
  - you can safely shop as long as it haven't see you yet
  - great if you really really don't want to deal with Skoude
- see: https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Stevari#Combat_Tips

Once you kill 3 Steves, Skoude will spawn in his place. Skoude is much, much, much tougher than steve. ways to counter **Skoude**:
- homing rock
  - only works before it sees you and activate his terrain distruction
- plasma beam
  - homing makes it trival
- ambrosia
- see: https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Skoude#Tips

## keybinds
- bind throw to somewhere like G so you can't accidentally click it.
  - i never use that key. i always open my inventory to throw stuff. some items, like tablets, can be thrown with a mouse click anyways.
- put water at slot 5, then bind slot 5 to Q to easily access water
- bind kick to right click. trust me it makes tablet kicking much much easier

## tablet, and kicking
- throwing a tablet on top of an enemy deals massive amounts of impact damage.
- the more advanced form of tablet throwing is **tablet kicking**.
  - to tablet kick, kick right _before_ throwing the tablet.
  - imo an essential skill to learn.
  - it's a nearly guarenteed way to oneshot an enemy.
- tablet kicking comes with a risk. use the tablet in risk free situations, or when it's less risky to tablet kick than to fight a strong enemy. don't risk your health to retrieve a thrown tablet.
- tablet throwing always count as trick/accident kills, giving you double gold. tablet kicking is a bit inconsistent for some reason.

- frozen enemies is exteremely vulnerable to physical damage, like kicking or tentacles. it's so strong that most enemies just get one-shot. very useful for dealing with Steve.

## walkthrough (contains spoilers)
### the mines
- pick up the tablet on the right side. it's not that important for beginners who haven't mastered tablet tech.
- the collapsed mines sucks. it literally has the same loot as normal mines.

### coal pits
- for the first two areas, i recommend exploring as much as you can. i know it's tempting to jump straight to the next areas with better loot, but they're also exponentially more dangerous. take advantage of the relative safery of the early areas to prepare yourself, get yourself strong enough to actually loot the tougher areas.
- to the left of the map is the Fungal Caverns. if you ever decide to go to the Fungal Caverns, be very, very careful.
  - watch out for the blindness mage, the teleport mage, and robocop (can't be stunned, bleeds oil, immune to a lot of things). the enemies there are already dangerous but these 3 can instantly end your run.

### snowy depths
- to the left of the map is the Fungal Caverns. if you ever decide to go to the Magical Temple, be very, very, very careful.
- to the right is a chasm that leads to Squidward's home, near the mines.
