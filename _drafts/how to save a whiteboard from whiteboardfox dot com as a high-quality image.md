title: How to save a whiteboard from Whiteboardfox.com as a high-quality image

1. go to responsive design mode (it's in the inspect element)
2. enlarge the screen until it covers everything you want. on firefox, `ctrl + -` to zoom out
3. `right click > save image`

I spent an embarrasing amount of time trying to figure it out. I tried to be a smartass and used the js console but firefox kept giving me CORS errors. I cannot believe the solution is this simple.
