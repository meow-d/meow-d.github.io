title: Why do I refuse to watch parkour civilization? it's because of Dream.
---

you know why I was a Dream stan? because he was cringe and free. that guy just uploads cringy 40-minute long videos of him and his friends having fun, no one hated him for being cringe. everyone roots for that guy everytime he's mentioned.

and we all know what happened. sure, he was a genuine asshole, it was a pretty big controversy, but all it takes is one controversy and cringe culture took over with no chance of recovery. it's hard to hate on people for being cringe without looking like the asshole that you are. that's why people hide behind legitmate reasons. once it's cool to hate him, it's a free for all, you can just make shit up now. donating thousands to LGBTQ charity just for some twitter user to make up some "he promised to donate all revenue in pride month but never streamed". streaming again to donate more, now the narrative changes to "haha he's finally saved face after being called out". what the fuck was the glow squid drama about again? guy just did something every youtuber does but apparently his fans are uniquely parasocial, and therefore it's his fault Mojang fucked it up.

I'm not going to get into the grooming and gumball controversy, I have stopped researching at this point, and I cannot trust anyone but myself for the research. but this isn't about him. it's about the people who heard someone was groomed and decided to celebrate. it's the people who make grooming jokes and pretend they're above people who make rape jokes.

parkour civilization is a ticking time bomb. maybe there will be some controversy, maybe not. eventually, people will start viewing it as the worst thing ever. I have no faith in the internet to be kind, to let people be themsleves. give them one spark and everything will be burned into the ground.

for the record, i never fully believed the groomer thing in the first place, i was just cautious and waiting for evidence. nowadays the consensus is that he really didn't do anything, but i don't wanna repeat the consensus without researching.
