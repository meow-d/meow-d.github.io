Let's take a few examples:

- Hunter X Hunter will always be peak no matter what it does. It's always flawless.

- My Hero Academia is mid. Demon Slayer is mid. (NEW!) Jujutsu Kaisen is mid.

These takes are _roughly_ correct, but it's so simplified to the point that it's not even useful anymore.

- HxH has flaws. all stories has flaws. pretending that HxH is above "all stories" is, in my opinion, very disrespectful, as it strips it of it's status as another story that someone on earth created.

- MHA and Demon Slayer isn't mid. Sure, they both have serious flaws, fumbled some important parts, have bland protagonists, parts of the story feels more generic that we would have liked. But they're miles ahead of the average manga. They each have things that made them special, that made them famous in the first place.

  _For example: Part of the casual appeal of Demon Slayer is Tanjiro's naive older brother vibe. He might be bland, but he has personality. I think Tanjiro's appeal is more subjective than most people think._

Even with that aside, using "mid" to imply that something is never worth watching is just wrong. Creating art takes a lot of skill and passion, and the end result is basically the authors child. Some aspects might appeal to some people, other aspects might turn off others. Everything is worth watching to _someone_ on earth, but they'll never know until they watch it. I think that's a good enough reason to justify their "mid" existence.

### bonus section

You fool. You though this post is over? No. I am now going to ✨subchost/vaguepost✨ two takes on Jujutsu Kaisen here on Cohost. _maybe this is a fandom drama post all along_

- "Jujutsu Kaisen is just a worse version of hxh" No, Jujutsu Kaisen is a love letter to HxH, along with every manga the author liked. I don't know how could a HxH fan hate JJK when the story constantly makes HxH references that make you go "yoooo is that a motherfucking HxH reference?!". _there's a JoJo reference too, if you're into that_

  And why does it have to surpass its predecessors? It's not like JJK promised to be a better version of HxH - I mean, who the hell would set out to do something so ambitious. If someone told you you're just a worse version of {someone you look up to}, it'll probably hurt. So don't say that to Greg's child.

- "JJK is a soulless shonen that doesn't understand what makes shonen good" Amazing, two of my least favourite phrases together. First of all, I don't understand "soulless". You can interpret it as "lacking personality", but that would be weird - people love JJK despite its numerous flaws because of its personality. I genuinely don't understand why people claim a heavily flawed piece of media is "soulless". If people love it despite its flaws, shouldn't that prove the opposite? Or maybe it's a shorthand for "I hate-watched the show so I don't care about anything".

  "{media} doesn't understand what makes {genre} good" is an amazing phrase. I've heard numerous "media critique youtubers" say it. Pretending you've someone cracked the code of a genre while pretending a massively successful author doesn't know the true secret. 10/10.
