title: Irene, the most popular Nichijou character you've never heard of
---

If you don't remember her, she's [the waitress who appeared in episode 9](https://nichijou.fandom.com/wiki/Waitress). No, it's okay if you forgot her, she doesn't even have a name. It's a classic case of a fandom so starved for content that they memed a character into existance.

"H-hey Irene existed!" I'm sorry, Irene is a fan character created by us collectively, extrapolated from the crumbs we were fed about _the waitress_. She was barely a character but we ship-of-theseus'ed made her into a complete one. She's the fandom's own babygirl. She's probably more popular than your fav - she's more popular than most favs.

While I don't know the exact origin of the name, I do have [this tweet from Mewochy (known as Snowiicat at the time)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220429181044/https://twitter.com/snowii_cat/status/1388580375295893510). I'm willing to bet Irene's popularity is single handedly caused by Meowchy.
