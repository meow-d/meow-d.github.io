Do you know people call Lumine 爷 in the CN fandom? no, not as in grandpa, but as in 少爷 (young master).

Apparently it started out as people mispronouncing her name (荧), and then it caught on cause it fits her sassy attitude really well. just look at her. she's 100% the kind who would call herself "young master".

the linguistics is interesting. it's mostly used as a first-person pronoun (like I, we, us) specifically for when you're Lumine, sometimes it's used as a third-person pronoun for Lumine specifically, though the lines between the two blur. in brainrot terms, it's a first person neo-pronoun for Lumine kinnies, and neo-pronoun for Lumine herself.

i genuinely don't know how one would mispronounce/misread 荧 as 爷 though. if i miss something please let me know.
