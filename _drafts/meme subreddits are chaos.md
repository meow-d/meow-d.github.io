So, some meme subreddits don't allow anything other than memes, like r/dankmemes. But the problem is that they're a community. There will always be discussions in the comments.

The only other way to communicate at all is to make a meme. A normal person would just say "I like pineapple pizza", but on r/Dankmemes, you find a template and then go to Photoshop to make an awful meme, "me when I say I like pineapple pizza". wanna share a really cute picture of a cat? download wholesome100.jpeg and edit it to say "cute 100". These entire subreddits are just like this - all extremely forced memes because normal posts are banned.

So people like SrGrafo make comics that are actually intentionally inorganically crafted meme templates, like how music artists manufacture tiktok trends; there are controversial templates like the Lisa Simpson presentation meme, where you're allowed to type literally anything, eventually banned but new ones kept popping up; there's a subreddit called r/MemeEconomy, where people create meme templates for the sake of blowing up, and people play a mini game where they "invest" in them.

Some templates become really really overused. People blame redditors for being unfunny and lazy, but in their defense, meme templates are their equivalent of grammar. Imagine having to invent new grammar every month because everyone was bored of the last one.

This gets worse when there's a conversation, where you get memes that reply to other memes, a take about whatever topic the community is talking about, etc. This is the entire thing the moderators are trying to avoid, but all they did is restrict proper discussion posts.

I think years of browsing Reddit had an effect on me. I thought it was cool to sarcastically epicly roast your opponents as a kid. now I kept trying to cover myself in irony because I don't have the emotional capacity to be empathetic.
