"just because you're young doesn't mean you can't be mature" says every 14 year old ever

to everyone past 14, it's tempting to project your past self at these people and laught at them. but that's not only ineffective, it's also misses the point.

to explain it in a way that (i think) don't offend my 14 year old past self:

---

imagine the 12 year old you. for the past two years, you've fucked up, and embarrased yourself a lot. but you learned a lot in the process. would you trust him to do anything you do now?

now imagine yourself in next two years. you will also fuck up a lot. you will also learn things the hard way.

communication is hard, no one can ever fully master it. i know you 14-year-olds love pointing at examples of adults fucking up, but that's my point. you cannot solve communication, you cannot be so emotionally mature you become zen. the best you can do is spend time on earth to learn things the hard way.

there is a reason some communities are relectant to allow 14 year olds.
